# zxHexChess
Hexagonal chess game built with Node JS.  Support for multiplayer and a computer opponent

## About
Gliński's Chess is one of many hexagonal variants of Chess.  As expected, it's played on a hexagon-shaped grid consisting of 91 smaller hexagons.
This is my third time trying my hand at hexagonal chess, and by far the most complete.  My first version featured local multiplayer and no Check
(therefore no checkmate or stalemate), and was missing en-passant.  My second version was much more polished, with check, checkmate, stalemate, and even
en-passant all implemented.  There was even a 'random bot' opponent, who would play any random legal move.
