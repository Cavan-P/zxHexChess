# QRSChess

QRSChess is my third, and probably final, attempt at a Hexagonal chess engine.
It's a web-based implementation of Gliński's variant of hexagonal chess, allowing one to play both online against a friend or against one of several bot opponents.

**NOTE:** The online version currently does not have a working implementation of the 'Expert' bot

## Tech Stack
Frontend: Vanilla JS, HTML5, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, WebSocket server
